"""Causal band-pass filtering. Needs scipy (the `build` extra).

The filter is causal, and that is the point. A zero-phase filter (`filtfilt`)
runs backwards as well as forwards and smears onset energy *ahead* of the
arrival. A model trained on that learns to "see" P before it has arrived, and
deployment, which can only filter forwards, takes that ability away. Training,
replay and the C++ runtime all filter with this: 4th-order Butterworth, 1–45 Hz,
second-order sections, state carried forward.

Each contiguous run of samples is filtered on its own, starting from
steady-state initial conditions, and missing samples are 0. A gap resets the
filter, just as a real-time filter has to restart after a gap.
